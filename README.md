# Balanced truncation with conformal maps
In the ./code there are all the files needed to run the experiments in the paper

> A. Borghi, T. Breiten, S. Gugercin, *Balanced truncation with conformal maps*, [ArXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15656) (2024) 

Below find a list of what script to run for each single section.

### Section 5.1 (Heat equation)
- `heat_equation.m` (for the time trajectories)
- `heat_equationH2.m` (for the H2 error)

### Section 5.2 (Schroedinger equation)
- `schroedinger_equation.m` (for the time trajectories)
- `schroedinger_equationH2.m` (for the H2 error)

### Section 5.3 (Wave equation)
- `wave_equation.m` (for the time trajectories)
